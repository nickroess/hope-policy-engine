# add_function_ranges() assigns a unique identifier to each function in a program.
# add_object_ranges() assigns a unique identifier to each object, including globals,
# heap allocation sites, and a few special kinds of objects.
#
# Both functions add their output into a range_file, which gets consumed by md_range
# to get incorporated into the .taginfo file.
# The tags placed on these words are either "Comp.funcID" or "Comp.globalID".
# The actual identifier is added to the .taginfo.args file which eventually
# gets set on the field values.
#
# These functions also produce func_defs.h and object_defs.h, which provide
# string labels for the created object identifiers for pretty printing / analysis.
# Note that currently add_object_ranges() must be called first, so that the heap_id
# can be passed to the function range tagger. TODO some cleanup.
